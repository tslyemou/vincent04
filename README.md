## What

FengNiao is a simple command-line util to deleting unused image resource files from you Xcode project.

## How

### Install

You need Swift Package Manager (as well as swift compiler) installed in your macOS, generally you are prepared if you have the latest Xcode installed.

#### Compile from source

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/onevcat/FengNiao.git
> cd FengNiao
> ./install.sh
```

FengNiao should be compiled, tested and installed into the `/usr/local/bin`.

#### Homebrew

You may want to install in from Homebrew. But for now it is not supported.

### Usage

Just navigate to your project folder, then:

```shell
> fengniao
```

It will scan current folder and all its subfolders to find unused images, then ask for you whether you want to delete them. Please make sure you have a backup or a version control system before you deleting the images, it will be an un-restorable operation.

FengNiao supports some arguments, you could find it by:

```shell
> fengniao --help

  -p, --project:
      Root path of your Xcode project. Default is current folder.
  --force:
      Delete the found unused files without asking.
  -e, --exclude:
      Exclude paths from search.
  -r, --resource-extensions:
      Resource file extensions need to be searched. Default is 'imageset jpg png gif'
  -f, --file-extensions:
      In which types of files we should search for resource usage. Default is 'm mm swift xib storyboard'
  --version:
      Print version.
  -h, --help:
      Print this help message.
```

A more daily-work usage under a project could be:

```shell
> fengniao --project . --exclude Carthage Pods
```

This will search in current folder, but skip the `Carthage` and `Pods` folder, in which there might be some third party resources you do not want to touch.

### Use with Xcode build phase

It is easy to integrate FengNiao into your Xcode build process. By doing so, you could ensure your project being cleaned every time you build your project. 

Add a "Run Script" phase in the Build Phases tab:

Then drap it above of "Copy Bundle Resources", editing its content to something like this:

```bash
fengniao --exclude Carthage --force
```

It is recommended to exclude vendor's folders like Pods or Carthage. Since you do not have a chance to confirm the result, you also need to add `--force` option.

## License and Information

FengNiao is open-sourced as MIT license. The name of this project comes from the Chinese word 蜂鸟 (hummingbird), which is the smallest bird in the world.

## Learning to Create

I streamed the way I created this tool as a live-coding session in a live platform in China. You can learn how to create a project with Swift Package Manager, how to apply Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP) in the project, and how to develop in a BDD way as well as write good tests there. 

It is a paid series lesson in Chinese. If you are interested in it, please check and watch the links below:
